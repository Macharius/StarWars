# Star Wars app

This project shows a way to perform the StarWars travel list project.
It contains all the required features and even a little bit more. But of course it is always possible to do more ðŸ˜‡. Below is a list of what could be interesting to do with some extra time.

## What to do with more time ?
 * Put image placeholder in case image loading fails
 * Add transition between the two screens (by sharing the pilot avatar picture )
 * Integrate a nicer placeholder when the data loading fails or returns an empty value
 * Add a memory cache repository
 * Add a persisted cache repository
 * Use a CollapsingToolbarLayout for detail view to handle small screens in a better way
 * Handle landscape orientation
 * Add pull to refresh in order to require fresher data
 * Add a signing config and check if there is no runtime issue with the current Proguard conf
 * Handle gracefully transition between loader and view (avoid blinking effect if network call is too fast)
